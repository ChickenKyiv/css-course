main css rules

border

in order to understand how to use rule `border` we need to undertand this 3 css rules
`border-width`:  width of border
`border-style`: style of border line. can be different, but usually we use only `solid`
`border-color`: color of border. we can have different colors, you can use names like `black, green, red`
but better to use HEX #ffffff, #000000 or RGB version rbg(255, 255, 0); if you work with design provided from designer, usually you'll use HEX version.


`border` is a shorthand of this 3 rules. first value related to witdh, second to style, third to color

You can also use borders for different sides of block. usually not used, but we'll cover it there quickly.
```
border-top: 1px solid blue;
border-bottom: 1px solid red;
border-left: 2px solid yellow;
border-right: 3px solid green;
```

border-radius:

help to change curve of corners
so if you want to have more rounded block, you'll need to increase the % of this corners
